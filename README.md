>The application is named BestWings, representing the idea taking flights into the world through the best routes. It allows users to search for flights not only by specific dates and prices but also by discovering the most optimal route.

This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.-->

### Elevator pitch

> BestWings is a smart flight search application that helps travelers save money and plan smoother trips. Unlike regular search tools, BestWings not only displays prices, luggage fees, meals, Wi-Fi availability, and services, but also highlights potential saving if the user flies a day earlier or later. By making the best route clear and flexible, it creates a stress-free experience â€” the perfect tool for first-time travelers and anyone who eager to explore the world.
