<!--[!NOTE]
This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.-->

### Elevator pitch

>DietBuilder is a smart nutrition-tracking application that helps users manage their dietary intake with ease. By entering their height, weight, and goal weight, users can instantly calculate their Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). They can then log the foods they eat throughout the day, and DietBuilder will compare their intake against RDA targets to highlight any nutritional deficiencies. Whether you窶决e looking to maintain weight, gain muscle, or improve your overall health, DietBuilder provides clear guidance and actionable insights to keep you on track.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

>- **HTML** -Build the structure for input forms (height, weight, food logs) and display nutrition analysis results.

>- **CSS** - Design a clear and simple interface, and style the logo in an appealing way.

>- **React** -Create reusable components for logging food, displaying RDA results, and navigating between pages (login, dashboard, history).
>- **Service** - Handle backend logic for user authentication, food database queries, and RDA calculations.
>- **DB/Login**
- Store user profiles, login credentials, daily logs, and historical nutrition data securely.
>- **WebSocket** - Provide real-time updates for shared or collaborative features (e.g., live progress sharing or quick syncing across devices).
