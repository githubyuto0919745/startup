Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.-->

### Elevator pitch

>DietBuilder is a smart nutrition-tracking application that helps users manage their dietary intake with ease. By entering their height, weight, and goal weight, users can instantly calculate their Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). They can then log the foods they eat throughout the day, and DietBuilder will compare their intake against RDA targets to highlight any nutritional deficiencies. Whether you窶决e looking to maintain weight, gain muscle, or improve your overall health, DietBuilder provides clear guidance and actionable insights to keep you on track.

### Key features

>- Log in and sign up
>- Search flights by destination and date, withprice ordering
>- Display the total price including luggage, meals, Wi-Fi, and any extra services

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

>- **HTML** -Build the structure for input forms (height, weight, food logs) and display nutrition analysis results.

>- **CSS** - Design a clear and simple interface, and style the logo in an appealing way.

>- **React** -Create reusable components for logging food, displaying RDA results, and navigating between pages (login, dashboard, history).
>- **Service** - Handle backend logic for user authentication, food database queries, and RDA calculations.
>- **DB/Login**
- Store user profiles, login credentials, daily logs, and historical nutrition data securely.
>- **WebSocket** - Provide real-time updates for shared or collaborative features (e.g., live progress sharing or quick syncing across devices).

- [ ] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://yourdomainnamehere.click).

## 泅 HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** -I created 4 pages: login.html, profile.html, dietinput.html, and graph.html.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used elements such as nav, div, select, and option to structure and display content across the pages.
- [x] **Links** -I linked all 4 pages using header titles for easy navigation.
- [x] **Text** -I created sections for users to input information to verify their account.

- [x] **Images** - I inserted icons and a logo to enhance the visual presentation.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - I implemented a login input and a placeholder function to demonstrate where user authentication will occur.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - I added a placeholder to show where user data from a database, such as profile information and saved diets, will appear.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - I added a placeholder to show where calorie tracking or live graph data will appear in real-time.

## 泅 CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** -I added a logo, adjusted font color and positions, included a background image for the main section, and placed each input button.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** -I implemented four different unit conversions to calculate BMI and TDEE, then used these values to display the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
For the search feature, I implemented functionality to display data results, allow users to select food items and specify quantities, and save this information to the intake list. The system then calculates and displays the total calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Finally, the app generates graphs based on both the user窶冱 profile and intake data for visual analysis.
